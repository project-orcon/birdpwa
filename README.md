## Notes
Following the tutorial from https://blog.sicara.com/a-progressive-web-application-with-vue-js-webpack-material-design-part-1-c243e2e6e402.  
Using Vuetify instead of material-design-lite.  
Images from random birb api - https://random.birb.pw.  
VueFire code is no longer up to date. Changed using this tutorial https://medium.com/@magyarn/vuefire-crud-todo-list-app-part-1-e069c46b50c6 - which only need a couple of modifications.
